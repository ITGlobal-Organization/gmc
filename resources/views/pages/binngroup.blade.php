Binn Group is Scotlandâ€™s leading independent recycling and waste management company, providing a range of waste services across Scotland to commercial, industrial and local authority clients.
Their main business operations take place at their 62 acre Binn Ecopark near Glenfarg which processes over 300,000 tonnes of material per year with a recycling rate in excess of 90%.
Customer focused, they provide a wide range of services, including skip and Roro hire, scrap metal recycling, trade waste collections (general waste, dry mixed recycling, glass and food waste) and events management. They are environmentally progressive, with a commitment to a circular economy.
They also operate a waste transfer station and metals reprocessing facility in Perth which offers a compliant and sustainable service for recycling all ferrous, non-ferrous and precious metals.
Binn Group is committed to providing reliable and efficient waste management solutions that prioritise recycling, waste minimisation and value for money. From their Glenfarg base we are well placed to collect waste and recycling from businesses across Perth and Kinross, Dundee, Angus, Fife and Central Scotland.
Together, this has culminated in the Binn Ecopark being one of the most fully integrated, lowcarbon, next generation resource recovery complexes in the UK, employing over 160 people and providing significant economic benefits and added value to the local economy.
