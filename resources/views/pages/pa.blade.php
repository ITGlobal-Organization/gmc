Founded in 1829, the Perthshire Advertiser - or 'the PA' as it's more commonly known - has been serving the communities of our region ever since.
Published on a Tuesday and a Friday, the PA news team strives to fill the paper with stories that are interesting, informative and hard-hitting - and always local.
Every week the paper gives a voice to those who need to be heard and takes a stand on the issues that affect the day to day lives of readers.
