<b>Why The Lending Channel supports the Chamber as a Platinum Partner </b><br>
We joined the Perthshire Chamber in 2015 and have attended many events over the years which have proved a great way of expanding our local network and finding out more about other local businesses. We decided to ramp up our marketing efforts in the local area and felt becoming a Platinum Partner was a major stepping stone to achieve this. Becoming a Platinum Partner also gives us the opportunity to sponsor an award at the Business Star Awards, which as a previous finalist is something we are excited about getting more involved in.
