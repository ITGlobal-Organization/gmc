<p>
One of the best things about UHI Perth is that we work hard to make sure all students succeed.<br>
We know that everyone has different reasons for becoming students, whether returning to study after a long break, or joining us straight from school.<br>
That's why we offer a range of options, from distance learning to part-time and full-time study on campus.<br>
In addition to our range of courses, we also offer different styles of learning to fit into your everyday life.<br>
<br><br>
<b>Why UHI Perth supports the Chamber as a Platinum Partner </b><br>
We are delighted to be working with The Perthshire Chamber of Commerce and are proud to be a Platinum partner. This working relationship provides us with a platform that genuinely
influences the economic environment within Perthshire and allows us to stay in touch with the business community across all business sectors. This allows UHI Perth to stay ahead of the
game in relation to student curriculum content by understanding ever changing industry needs, trends, and future direction. This ensures our students always have up to date learning
content that makes them attractive to future employers.
