    We work closely with partners including DiT, SDI, SE and others to support trade exploration whatever stage a business is at.
    <br><br>
    We also have a great network of contacts who have experience, skills and trade in the global market place and are keen to support fellow businesses to this end.
    <br><br>
    We coordinate a range of Trade Missions for Scottish companies so if you are looking to learn more about exporting, access new markets and are ready to take your product/service out to international markets, please get in touch with us.

    Network wide hosting of both inward and outward trade missions to increase the number of businesses exporting and discovering new markets.  Those new markets may be out with the UK, Scotland or even just out with Perthshire.  Wherever these new markets are – there is growth potential for most companies and we can explore this together.
