    If Business Mentoring is something that you would be interested in looking further into, then the first stage of the process is for you to complete some forms to give us more information about your business and what you would like to gain from having a mentor then we would process this and can get the mentoring match started. Alternatively, if you would rather discuss this over zoom or a phone call with Vicki, that can be arranged (vicki@perthshirechamber.co.uk or calling 01738 448325).
